            <p class="text-head upper"> Luke Skywalker </p>
            <p class="p-bg">Like any typical millennial, Luke has a high degree of web literacy and often goes online. 
                He is planning to go camping with his father on the planet Tatooine, Darth Vader, next weekend. 
                <br>
                <br>He is anxious about the weather and checks every website enthusiastically. 
                He wants a website where it shows more than a current temperature. He wants every website to be very similar to the ones he has previously visited so that it becomes easy to get accustomed to the site in less than a minute. </p>

            <h3> Persona #2 </h3> 
            <p class="text-head upper"> Darth Manahari </p>
            <p class="p-bg"> Manahari is now the Sith Lord of the entire galaxy. Darth Manahari wants to conquer the entire universe. However, there is a great disturbance in the force. 
                A young Jedi has become a thorn in Darth Manahari's conquest to dominance.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is a perfect opportunity for the Sith Lord to show his prowess.
                The Sith Lord desires all Jedi to be exterminated, so he can rule the entire universe without worrying about pests. 
                Before doing that, he wants to check the weather condition, so he visits lizweathersweather.com.
